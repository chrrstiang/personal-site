SIDE MENU:--------------------------------
- Biography
- Experience
- Skillset
- Goals

Clicking on item in menu leads to that section of the page with a smooth rolling transition
-------------------------------------------


SKILLSET CATEGORY: ------------------------

Idea 1: Have headers transition into display with icons in a constant transition roll to left/right

- Language Icons (Javascript, Java, Typescript?)
- Framework/Utility Icons(React, Next, Supabase, Chakra/MUI, WebSocket)

Idea 2: Display Header with a large bubble of Icons below the header, imitating bubbles in water

^ Same icon ideas as above

-------------------------------------------


EXPERIENCE CATEGORY: ----------------------

Idea 1: Similar to resume, Company is shown as header with position and key points following underneath

COMPANY NAME
Position
Detail 1
Detail 2
Detail 3

Idea 2: Display clickable cards with Company/Position
2.1: On click, a modal is opened with further details on the role
2.2: On click, transiton into new page.

Content would include key details about job, possibly logo, but otherwise not sure what else
It may make more sense to do a modal since it's not much content
